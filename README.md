# 👋 I’m RegardV - AI-Ops Visionary

I’m an **AI-Ops pioneer** blending DevOps foundations with cutting-edge AI to build autonomous, intelligent systems. From spinning up Ubuntu VMs and Docker containers to orchestrating **agentic workflows**, I’m passionate about automating the future. I’ve engineered an AI agent with Abacus Agent Builder that mastered FICA and AML regulatory requirements and developed a CrewAI pipeline that transforms niche ideas into 30-day journaling PDFs—complete with curated content, organic rewrites, and lead magnets.

My toolkit? **Python**, **n8n**, and LLMs like Janus, Stable Diffusion, and Whisper, paired with a knack for prompt engineering and workflow design. With a background in programming (Pascal, Delphi, VBA, SQL) and database management from the late ’90s, I think like a coder and leverage AI to bridge modern gaps, rapidly learning and deploying solutions. I’ve even built a VBA tool to streamline client management, condensing sprawling data into a single, clickable interface.

## 🚀 What I’m Building
- **Agentic Systems**: Crafting AI crews that automate content creation, from journals to marketing campaigns.
- **Intelligent Automation**: Designing workflows that think, adapt, and deliver business value.
- **AI-Ops Innovation**: Exploring scalable AI deployments to revolutionize operations.

## 🔍 Staying Cutting-Edge
I’m obsessed with staying ahead of the curve in AI-Ops. I dive into the latest advancements in LLMs, agentic frameworks, and automation tools, experimenting with emerging tech like next-gen prompt engineering and autonomous systems. By tracking industry trends and testing bleeding-edge solutions, I ensure my workflows and systems are always at the forefront of innovation.

## 🌟 My Vision
I’m working toward a platform that empowers a journaling community, driven by AI-powered content and marketing automation. Whether it’s stitching together workflows or architecting enterprise-grade pipelines, I thrive on solving complex problems with AI as my co-pilot.

## 🚀 Current Projects

### Agentic Workflow: CourseCraft Crew
- **[CourseCraft-Crew](https://github.com/RegardV/CourseCraftCrew)**  
  ![Workflow Status](https://github.com/RegardV/CourseCraftCrew/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)  
  An AI-powered platform using **CrewAI** and the **xAI API** to automate self-help course creation—like “Journaling for Anxiety.” Still in development, it’s my proving ground for agent-driven content generation, from research to polished PDFs—destined for platforms like Gumroad.  
  - **What’s Done:** Phase 1 is complete, Outputting a complete PDF 
  - **Next Up:** Testing Phase 2, Having said pdf final with images integrated.
  - **Line-up:** Generating Audio, video, to accompany the project.

### Local Multimodal LLM: Janusvision
- **[Janusvision](https://github.com/RegardV/Janusvision)**  
  **(Paused)**<br>
  A Dockerized web app running **Janus-Pro-7B** from DeepSeek, featuring a Gradio UI for text-to-image generation and image-based insights. Built with GPU acceleration on an Ubuntu KVM with passthroughs and VRAM spillover for an 8GB RTX 4070 (mobile), it’s a solid proof-of-concept for multimodal AI—now on the backburner.  
  - **What’s Done:** Deployed a functional app with CUDA support, optimized builds with caching, and enabled LAN access for testing.  
  - **Next Up :** Tuning performance, expanding features (e.g., text-only queries), and refining the UI—on hold to focus on agentic systems.  

<!-- Tip as a comment for you -->
<!-- Tip: Your Janusvision README is detailed—consider archiving the repo to signal its paused status! -->

## 🤖 Why AI Agents?
After building VBA software for work right in Excel using ChatGPT, I’m sold on AI that doesn’t just obey—it *thinks* and *teams up*. Every prompt I tweak feels like a step toward a self-running system. This GIF captures my grind—and my wins:
