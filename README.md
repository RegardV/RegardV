# 👋 Hey, I’m RegardV - DevOps Enthusiast & AI Agent Builder

<!-- Bio: Ties in AI-driven marketing and Gumroad -->
I’m a DevOps practitioner with a few months of hands-on experience, now leveling up into **AI and agentic systems**. I’ve built a foundation with virtual machines, environments and containers, and I’m hooked on creating workflows where AI agents run the show— from automation to social marketing strategies for platforms like Gumroad. Prompt engineering and autonomous deployments are my current obsessions—join me as I push the boundaries of what I once thought was impossible!

<!-- Learning Section: Fixed and completed -->
## 🧠 What I’m Mastering
- **Prompt Engineering:** Fine-tuning inputs to unlock AI’s full potential.
- **Agentic Systems:** Orchestrating AI agents that collaborate seamlessly.
- **DevOps Core:** Scaling up from Ubuntu VMs and Docker to smarter automation.

<!-- Projects Section: Subtle Gumroad tie-in for CourseCraft -->
## 🚀 Current Projects

### Agentic Workflow: CourseCraft Crew
- **[CourseCraft-Crew](https://github.com/RegardV/coursecraft_crew)**  
  An AI-powered platform using **CrewAI** and the **xAI API** to automate self-help course creation—like “Journaling for Anxiety.” Still in development, it’s my proving ground for agent-driven content generation, from research to polished PDFs—destined for platforms like Gumroad.  
  - **What’s Done:** Phase 1 is complete—text and image-based courses ready for testing with a 2-3 page PDF output.  
  - **Next Up:** Testing Phase 1, then adding audio (Phase 2) and video (Phase 3) by May 2025.

<!-- Tip: Update the repo link once it’s live—use this as motivation to push your code! -->

### Local Multimodal LLM: Janusvision
- **[Janusvision](https://github.com/RegardV/Janusvision)**  
  A Dockerized web app running **Janus-Pro-7B** from DeepSeek, featuring a Gradio UI for text-to-image generation and image-based insights. Built with GPU acceleration on an Ubuntu KVM with passthroughs and Vram spillover for 8gb RTX4070(mobile), it’s a solid proof-of-concept for multimodal AI—now on the backburner.  
  - **What’s Done:** Deployed a functional app with CUDA support, optimized builds with caching, and enabled LAN access for testing.  
  - **Next Up (Paused to focus on Agentic systems):** Tuning performance, expanding features (e.g., text-only queries), and refining the UI—on hold for now.  

<!-- Tip as a comment for you -->
<!-- Tip: Your Janusvision README is detailed—consider archiving the repo or marking it inactive to signal its paused status! -->

## 🤖 Why AI Agents?
After building a VBA software for my work right in Excell using chat GPT, I’m sold on AI that doesn’t just obey—it *thinks* and *teams up*. Every prompt I tweak feels like a step toward a self-running system. This GIF captures my grind—and my wins:
