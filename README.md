# 👋 Hey, I’m RegardV - DevOps Enthusiast & AI Agent Builder

<!-- Bio: Your tweak with virtual machines and "what I once thought was impossible" -->
I’m a DevOps practitioner with a few months of hands-on experience, now leveling up into **AI and agentic systems**. I’ve built a foundation with virtual machines, environments, and containers, and I’m hooked on creating workflows where AI agents run the show—from automation to social marketing strategies for platforms like Gumroad. Prompt engineering and autonomous deployments are my current obsessions—join me as I push the boundaries of what I once thought was impossible!

## 🚀 Current Projects

### Agentic Workflow: CourseCraft Crew
- **[CourseCraft-Crew](https://github.com/RegardV/CourseCraftCrew)**  
  ![Workflow Status](https://github.com/RegardV/CourseCraftCrew/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)  
  An AI-powered platform using **CrewAI** and the **xAI API** to automate self-help course creation—like “Journaling for Anxiety.” Still in development, it’s my proving ground for agent-driven content generation, from research to polished PDFs—destined for platforms like Gumroad.  
  - **What’s Done:** Phase 1 is complete—text- and image-based courses ready for testing with a 2-3 page PDF output.  
  - **Next Up:** Testing Phase 1, then adding audio (Phase 2) and video (Phase 3) by April 2025.

### Local Multimodal LLM: Janusvision
- **[Janusvision](https://github.com/RegardV/Janusvision)**  
  **(Paused)**<br>
  A Dockerized web app running **Janus-Pro-7B** from DeepSeek, featuring a Gradio UI for text-to-image generation and image-based insights. Built with GPU acceleration on an Ubuntu KVM with passthroughs and VRAM spillover for an 8GB RTX 4070 (mobile), it’s a solid proof-of-concept for multimodal AI—now on the backburner.  
  - **What’s Done:** Deployed a functional app with CUDA support, optimized builds with caching, and enabled LAN access for testing.  
  - **Next Up :** Tuning performance, expanding features (e.g., text-only queries), and refining the UI—on hold to focus on agentic systems.  

<!-- Tip as a comment for you -->
<!-- Tip: Your Janusvision README is detailed—consider archiving the repo to signal its paused status! -->

<!-- Fun Fact Section: Your VBA story with minor polish -->
## 🤖 Why AI Agents?
After building VBA software for work right in Excel using ChatGPT, I’m sold on AI that doesn’t just obey—it *thinks* and *teams up*. Every prompt I tweak feels like a step toward a self-running system. This GIF captures my grind—and my wins:
