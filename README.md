# 👋 I’m Regard, and I build solutions.
AI Enthusiast, Workflows, Automations, FastApi, Go High Level, Blockchain(to a much lesser extent).. Learning and Building. 

## 💻 What I am Doing
Im Fine tuning a docker AI studio setup to run on my local machine Xeon 2350V3 12 core 64gb ram and rtx 3090
It ended up beinge called n8n -ai studio but now that might be redundant as I am looking at moving over to [simai](https://docs.sim.ai/introduction)

Currently running the following containers:
* [n8n ](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n)
* [ComfyUI](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI-Manager)
* [Chatterbox-tts](https://github.com/devnen/Chatterbox-TTS-Server) But looking into https://github.com/petermg/Chatterbox-TTS-Extended
* [Remotion](https://github.com/remotion-dev/remotion) 
* [Postiz](https://github.com/gitroomhq/postiz-app)
* [Simai (Still setting this one up not 100% Functional yet) ](https://github.com/simstudioai/sim)

* ngix
* postgres
* redis

## 🔍 Staying Cutting-Edge

I’m dedicated to staying at the forefront of AI-Ops by exploring advancements in LLMs, agentic frameworks, and automation tools. I experiment with next-gen prompt engineering, autonomous systems, and scalable deployments, while tracking industry trends to ensure my solutions remain innovative and impactful.

## 🤝 Let’s Connect

I’m eager to collaborate on projects that push the boundaries of AI, automation, and DevOps. Reach out to explore how we can build intelligent, impactful systems together!

## 🪄 Fun Fact: I was born in Pretoria, South Africa—the same hometown as Elon Musk. It’s a quirky coincidence that fuels my drive to push boundaries and dream big in the world of AI-Ops!


ARCHIVE:
(some time ago)I just completed building V1 [AI-studio-Video Pipleline](https://github.com/RegardV/n8n-ai-home-content-studio) I am keeping this as a rememberance but I will post a new one this old one is nonsense. so many broken things)
