# Building Production AI Systems That Run in My Garage

**AI Workflow Engineer** | Shipping autonomous content factories & agentic dev teams on sovereign infrastructure

---

## 🚀 What I Ship

### **Shorts Factory** – Autonomous Content Engine
**70+ videos live** across YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, X with **zero manual intervention**

**Production System (Live Now)**:
- **85-90% local inference** – no API dependency hell
- Full pipeline: n8n → ComfyUI → Remotion → Chatterbox-TTS → Postiz
- Running 24/7 from Pretoria on Xeon E3 + RTX 3090

→ [**Personal Dashboard**]([Personal Development Roadmap](https://www.realandworks.com/digitatwins)) (Business hours GMT+2)

**Business Impact**: Scaled content production from 0 to 70+ pieces while eliminating $500+/month in API costs

### **Claude Autonomous Coding Team** – Zero-Cloud Dev Squad
Senior-level development pipeline with **zero external dependencies**:
- OpenSpec enforcement for consistency
- Automated drift detection & PR-Agent reviews  
- Human-in-the-loop gates for critical decisions
- Single script deployment

**Impact**: What took 3 days now takes 3 hours. Code quality improved, human bottlenecks eliminated.

### **CrewAI Production Systems**
- **30-Day PDF Journal Generator**: CLI shipped, frontend 85% complete
- **Hummingbot Trading Manager**: Autonomous trading orchestration
- **Family Finance Tracker**: Bank statement parsing + budget automation

---

## 🎯 What I Solve

**The Problem**: Companies want AI agents but can't afford the cloud bills, data leakage risks, or API rate limits.

**My Solution**: Production-grade agentic systems that run **locally, privately, and profitably**.

- ✅ **Sovereignty**: Your data never leaves your infrastructure
- ✅ **Cost Control**: 85-90% local = 90% cost reduction vs. cloud APIs
- ✅ **Compliance**: POPIA/GDPR-ready by default
- ✅ **Reliability**: No rate limits, no API downtime

## 📍 Location & Context

Based in **Pretoria, South Africa** (yes, same city as Elon – the coincidence keeps me ambitious).

Running production AI systems from my garage. Proving you don't need SF rent or cloud budgets to ship world-class AI.
