# üëã I‚Äôm RegardV - AI-Ops Systems Architect & Creative Automation Specialist

I‚Äôm a driven **AI-Ops innovator** who fuses DevOps principles with cutting-edge AI to craft intelligent, autonomous systems. With a passion for streamlining complex challenges into efficient workflows, I excel at blending code, automation, and creativity to deliver impactful solutions. My mission is to build systems that empower businesses and communities by automating repetitive tasks and unlocking human potential.

## üíª What I Do

I design and deploy **agentic workflows** and intelligent automation pipelines that drive measurable outcomes. My recent projects include:

- **X Tweet Scraper (n8n Workflow)**: Built a robust workflow on my self-hosted n8n server to scrape and analyze tweets from X in real-time. *Value*: This tool enables businesses and creators to extract actionable insights from social media trends, monitor brand sentiment, and curate content for marketing campaigns, saving hours of manual effort and supporting data-driven decisions.
- **Abacus Agent Builder**: Trained an AI agent on South Africa‚Äôs FICA and AML regulatory requirements, achieving an 80%+ pass rate.
- **CrewAI Pipeline**: Developed a 30-day journaling PDF generator that curates content, rewrites organically, and creates lead magnets for niche audiences.
- **Full-Stack Flask App**: Created a single-page application on Node.js and Flask, integrated with LLMs, and deployed on Render. This modular project lays the groundwork for a larger, scalable workflow.

My toolkit spans **Python**, **n8n**, **VS Code**, and LLMs like Grok, ChatGPT, and Claude, enhanced by advanced prompt engineering and workflow design. With a programming foundation in Pascal, Delphi, VBA, and SQL from the late ‚Äô90s, I combine a coder‚Äôs rigor with modern AI to rapidly learn, adapt, and implement solutions. A past highlight includes a VBA-based client management tool that transformed complex data into a user-friendly, clickable interface.

## üöÄ Current Projects & Learning

I‚Äôm continuously expanding my expertise to stay ahead in AI-Ops and automation, with a strong focus on secure and reliable practices:

- **Front-to-End Video Creator and Social Poster**: Developing an n8n-based workflow to automate video content creation, editing, and posting to social platforms, streamlining content pipelines for creators and marketers with AI-driven scripting and scheduling.
- **AI Mail Assistant**: Building an intelligent email automation tool using n8n and LLMs to categorize, prioritize, and draft responses, enhancing productivity by reducing email overload.
- **Agentic Systems**: Transitioning from a CrewAI project (Jan‚ÄìMar 2025) to a modular, scalable setup using Agno for content creation and marketing automation.
- **Full-Stack Growth**: Deepening my skills in Python, Node.js, Flask, and React, while mastering CLI tools, Linux, and Git for seamless deployments.

**Vibe Coding Philosophy**: I‚Äôm acutely aware of security challenges in vibe coding, such as vulnerabilities in experimental code, unsecured APIs, or misconfigured systems, which can expose projects to risks like data breaches or unauthorized access. My approach mitigates these by restricting vibe coding to learning and experimentation, ensuring that any deployment leverages official, battle-tested platforms. For example, my X Tweet Scraper and Flask app are deployed via established systems like n8n and Render, guaranteeing security and reliability. Within this secure framework, I practice vibe coding as a creative and disciplined process, iterating boldly while safeguarding base templates. My strength lies in intuitively reading code, spotting flow issues, and refactoring with precision when prompts alone aren‚Äôt enough. For learning, I embrace tools like xAI‚Äôs Grok for precise sequential processing, allowing me to focus on innovation during development while maintaining rigorous standards for production.

## üåü Side Projects & Achievements

- **Sales Page Builder**: Engineered a semi-automated workflow that generates production-grade landing pages using prompt engineering and visual design automation. A selection of base templates for landing pages a good point to start from, Promt engineering made these possible, not perfect, but its 80% there, and takes 5-7 minutes each: [InkyPyrus Landing pages](https://regardv.github.io/landings/). (Open to commissions, not currently taking orders.)
- **n8n Server Deployment**: Successfully spun up a self-hosted n8n server to power custom automation workflows, demonstrating infrastructure management and optimization skills. The domain is managed through Cloudflare, with configurations optimized for security and protection against potential attacks, ensuring robust performance and resilience.
- **AI-Ops Foundations**: Invested early 2025 in mastering CrewAI, Python, and Linux, with $150 in tokens as my ‚Äúschool fees‚Äù for hands-on learning via Cline-coder and Abacus.ai agents.

## üîç Staying Cutting-Edge

I‚Äôm dedicated to staying at the forefront of AI-Ops by exploring advancements in LLMs, agentic frameworks, and automation tools. I experiment with next-gen prompt engineering, autonomous systems, and scalable deployments, while tracking industry trends to ensure my solutions remain innovative and impactful.

## üõ†Ô∏è My Vision

I envision a world where intelligent automation liberates human capital from repetitive tasks, unleashing boundless potential for creativity, innovation, and connection. I‚Äôm building AI-driven systems that seamlessly handle complex workflows‚Äîwhether generating personalized content, streamlining marketing pipelines, or optimizing business operations‚Äîso individuals and organizations can focus on what truly matters. With AI as my co-pilot, I‚Äôm architecting solutions that empower communities and redefine productivity, one automated system at a time.

## ü§ù Let‚Äôs Connect

I‚Äôm eager to collaborate on projects that push the boundaries of AI, automation, and DevOps. Reach out to explore how we can build intelligent, impactful systems together!

## ü™Ñ Fun Fact: I was born in Pretoria, South Africa‚Äîthe same hometown as Elon Musk. It‚Äôs a quirky coincidence that fuels my drive to push boundaries and dream big in the world of AI-Ops!
