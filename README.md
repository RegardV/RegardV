 I’m RegardV - AI-Ops Visionary
I’m an AI-Ops pioneer blending DevOps foundations with cutting-edge AI to build autonomous, intelligent systems. From spinning up Ubuntu VMs and Docker containers to orchestrating agentic workflows, I’m passionate about automating the future. I’ve engineered an AI agent with Abacus Agent Builder that mastered FICA and AML regulatory requirements and developed a CrewAI pipeline that transforms niche ideas into 30-day journaling PDFs—complete with curated content, organic rewrites, and lead magnets.
My toolkit? Python, n8n, and LLMs like Janus, Stable Diffusion, and Whisper, paired with a knack for prompt engineering and workflow design. With a background in programming (Pascal, Delphi, VBA, SQL) and database management from the late ’90s, I think like a coder and leverage AI to bridge modern gaps, rapidly learning and deploying solutions. I’ve even built a VBA tool to streamline client management, condensing sprawling data into a single, clickable interface.
 What I’m Building
Agentic Systems: Crafting AI crews that automate content creation, from journals to marketing campaigns.

Intelligent Automation: Designing workflows that think, adapt, and deliver business value.

AI-Ops Innovation: Exploring scalable AI deployments to revolutionize operations.

 My Vision
I’m working toward a platform that empowers a journaling community, driven by AI-powered content and marketing automation. Whether it’s stitching together workflows or architecting enterprise-grade pipelines, I thrive on solving complex problems with AI as my co-pilot.
Check out my repos and let’s collaborate to build systems that don’t just run—they create.

## 🚀 Current Projects

### Agentic Workflow: CourseCraft Crew
- **[CourseCraft-Crew](https://github.com/RegardV/CourseCraftCrew)**  
  ![Workflow Status](https://github.com/RegardV/CourseCraftCrew/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)  
  An AI-powered platform using **CrewAI** and the **xAI API** to automate self-help course creation—like “Journaling for Anxiety.” Still in development, it’s my proving ground for agent-driven content generation, from research to polished PDFs—destined for platforms like Gumroad.  
  - **What’s Done:** Phase 1 is complete, Outputting a complete PDF 
  - **Next Up:** Testing Phase 2, Having said pdf final with images integrated.
  - **Line-up:** Generating Audio, video, to accompany the project.

### Local Multimodal LLM: Janusvision
- **[Janusvision](https://github.com/RegardV/Janusvision)**  
  **(Paused)**<br>
  A Dockerized web app running **Janus-Pro-7B** from DeepSeek, featuring a Gradio UI for text-to-image generation and image-based insights. Built with GPU acceleration on an Ubuntu KVM with passthroughs and VRAM spillover for an 8GB RTX 4070 (mobile), it’s a solid proof-of-concept for multimodal AI—now on the backburner.  
  - **What’s Done:** Deployed a functional app with CUDA support, optimized builds with caching, and enabled LAN access for testing.  
  - **Next Up :** Tuning performance, expanding features (e.g., text-only queries), and refining the UI—on hold to focus on agentic systems.  

<!-- Tip as a comment for you -->
<!-- Tip: Your Janusvision README is detailed—consider archiving the repo to signal its paused status! -->

<!-- Fun Fact Section: Your VBA story with minor polish -->
## 🤖 Why AI Agents?
After building VBA software for work right in Excel using ChatGPT, I’m sold on AI that doesn’t just obey—it *thinks* and *teams up*. Every prompt I tweak feels like a step toward a self-running system. This GIF captures my grind—and my wins:
