# 👋 I'm Regard – Self-Taught AI Workflow Engineer (Pretoria)

Started my serious AI journey **January 2025** – in less than 12 months I’ve gone from zero to shipping real production systems on local hardware.

### What I actually ship and run today

**Shorts Factory** – 70+ videos live across YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, X  
• v1 (Apr–Oct 2025): self-hosted n8n + GPT-4 + Runware + Creatomate + Blotato – fully hands-off production  
• Current rebuild (active, 85–90 % local): n8n → ComfyUI → Remotion → Chatterbox-TTS → Postiz  
  Live demo running 24/7 from my garage: https://postiz.realandworks.com

**Claude Autonomous Coding Team** – zero-cloud senior dev squad  
Single script, OpenSpec enforcement, drift detection, PR-Agent reviews, human-in-the-loop gates

**CrewAI Projects**  
• 30-day PDF writing journal generator (CLI complete, frontend in progress)  
• Hummingbot trading manager  
• Family finance tracker (bank-statement parsing & budgeting)

### Local stack I run daily
Docker
n8n | ComfyUI | Remotion | Chatterbox-TTS(basic as full requires ASX on CPU) | Postiz | Nginx | Postgres | Redis | Postgres 
Hardware: Xeon E3 + 64 GB RAM + RTX 3090

### Focus areas
Agentic workflows · Sovereign / privacy-first AI · LLM Ops · Prompt engineering · Local inference · Cost & compliance control

Open to collaborations on production-grade agentic systems and ethical automation.

Pretoria-born (yes, same as Elon – the coincidence keeps me ambitious).
