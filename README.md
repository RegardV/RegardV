# üëã I‚Äôm Regard, and I build solutions.
AI Enthusiast, Workflows, Automations, FastApi, Go High Level, Blockchain(to a much lesser extent).. Learning and Building. 

I‚Äôm a driven **AI-Ops innovator** who fuses DevOps principles with cutting-edge AI to craft intelligent, autonomous systems. With a passion for streamlining complex challenges into efficient workflows, I excel at blending code, automation, and creativity to deliver impactful solutions. My mission is to build systems that empower businesses and communities by automating repetitive tasks and unlocking human potential.

## üíª What I Do
I just completed building V1 AI-studio its a docker environment (The Studio will evolve but this is the starting point.) currently running: 
* n8n
* ComfyUI
* kokoro TTS
* FFCreator
* ngix
* postgres
* redis

Due to running on a 12 core xeon 32 gb ram and RTX 3080 10gb I wrote this: 
.[RTX Meomory Manager](https://github.com/RegardV/rtx-gpu-memory-manager) 
to help with memory on the RTX

My toolkit spans **Python**, **n8n**, **VS Code**, and LLMs like Grok, ChatGPT, and Claude, enhanced by advanced prompt engineering and workflow design. With a programming foundation in Pascal, Delphi, VBA, and SQL from the late ‚Äô90s, I combine a coder‚Äôs rigor with modern AI to rapidly learn, adapt, and implement solutions. A past highlight includes a VBA-based client management tool that transformed complex data into a user-friendly, clickable interface.

## üåü Side Projects & Achievements

-**RTX GPU Memory Manager**: Built and open-sourced a comprehensive GPU memory management system for the RTX community. The project addresses common memory leak issues in ComfyUI, Kokoro TTS, and other AI applications through intelligent automation and safety-first design. Features include multiple configuration profiles, extensive documentation, GitHub Actions CI/CD, and professional issue templates for community contributions. The MIT-licensed solution has grown to include 34+ files, comprehensive testing, and supports all RTX 30/40 series GPUs: RTX GPU Memory Manager.

***(Closed off this project focusing on AI automations and Agentic workflows going forward)***

- **Sales Page Builder**: Engineered a semi-automated workflow that generates production-grade landing pages using prompt engineering and visual design automation. A selection of base templates for landing pages a good point to start from, Promt engineering made these possible, not perfect, but its 80% there, and takes 5-7 minutes each: [InkyPyrus Landing pages](https://regardv.github.io/landings/). (Open to commissions, not currently taking orders.)
- **n8n Server Deployment**: Successfully spun up a self-hosted n8n server to power custom automation workflows, demonstrating infrastructure management and optimization skills. The domain is managed through Cloudflare, with configurations optimized for security and protection against potential attacks, ensuring robust performance and resilience.
- **AI-Ops Foundations**: Invested early 2025 in mastering CrewAI, Python, and Linux, with $150 in tokens as my ‚Äúschool fees‚Äù for hands-on learning via Cline-coder and Abacus.ai agents.

## üîç Staying Cutting-Edge

I‚Äôm dedicated to staying at the forefront of AI-Ops by exploring advancements in LLMs, agentic frameworks, and automation tools. I experiment with next-gen prompt engineering, autonomous systems, and scalable deployments, while tracking industry trends to ensure my solutions remain innovative and impactful.

## üõ†Ô∏è My Vision

I envision a world where intelligent automation liberates human capital from repetitive tasks, unleashing boundless potential for creativity, innovation, and connection. I‚Äôm building AI-driven systems that seamlessly handle complex workflows‚Äîwhether generating personalized content, streamlining marketing pipelines, or optimizing business operations‚Äîso individuals and organizations can focus on what truly matters. With AI as my co-pilot, I‚Äôm architecting solutions that empower communities and redefine productivity, one automated system at a time.

## ü§ù Let‚Äôs Connect

I‚Äôm eager to collaborate on projects that push the boundaries of AI, automation, and DevOps. Reach out to explore how we can build intelligent, impactful systems together!

## ü™Ñ Fun Fact: I was born in Pretoria, South Africa‚Äîthe same hometown as Elon Musk. It‚Äôs a quirky coincidence that fuels my drive to push boundaries and dream big in the world of AI-Ops!
