# Model Context Protocol (MCP): Vision and Resources

## The Vision

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, launched by Anthropic in November 2024, is an open-source standard designed to bridge Large Language Models (LLMs) like Claude with the real world—think websites, APIs, databases, and tools. It’s a middleware layer that lets AIs talk to systems effortlessly, turning prompts into actions and data into insights.

Imagine asking your AI to "summarize this webpage" or "fetch my latest GitHub PRs," and it just *works*—no custom hacks, no brittle integrations. MCP’s vision is to become the universal connector for AI agents, much like HTTP powers the web or USB unifies hardware. It’s modular: "plugs" (servers) define how an AI interacts with specific systems, while the protocol keeps it all consistent. Whether you’re pulling live data from a news site or pushing commands to a tool, MCP aims to make AI truly agentic—active, not just reactive.

## Why It’s Exciting

- **Seamless AI Integration**: No more reinventing the wheel for every AI-to-system link. MCP standardizes it, so your AI can tap into websites or apps with minimal fuss.
- **Open and Extensible**: Open-source means anyone can build plugs—want your AI to scrape a site or query a blockchain? You can make it happen.
- **Future-Proof**: As of March 2025, it’s early but buzzing—adopters like Sourcegraph and community projects (e.g., Solana MCP servers) hint at a growing ecosystem. This could be *the* standard for AI agents.
- **Empowerment**: Developers get a framework to unleash AI potential, from simple queries to complex workflows, all in a unified way.

MCP isn’t just a protocol—it’s a step toward AIs that act as partners, not just chatbots. That’s why it’s worth exploring now.

## Provider Efforts

Here’s how key players are shaping the MCP ecosystem:

### Anthropic
- **Role**: The creators of MCP, driving its core development and adoption.
- **Efforts**: 
  - Launched MCP on November 25, 2024, with reference servers for Google Drive, Slack, GitHub, Postgres, and Puppeteer.
  - Released Python and TypeScript SDKs, with Kotlin and Java SDKs in progress (collaborations with JetBrains and Spring AI).
  - Integrated MCP into Claude Desktop for native support.

  - [TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk)
  - [Kotlin SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/kotlin-sdk)
  - [Java SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/java-sdk)
  - [Official Site](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)

### Solana
- **Role**: A blockchain community extending MCP into decentralized systems.
- **Efforts**: 
  - Launched an MCP server competition in March 2025 (announced via X), encouraging developers to build Solana-specific plugs (e.g., for querying blockchain data or executing transactions).
  - Early submissions include a Solana transaction fetcher, showing MCP’s versatility beyond traditional apps.

### Others
- **Role**: Community and third-party contributors expanding MCP’s reach.
- **Efforts**:
  - **Sourcegraph**: Integrated MCP into Cody, their AI coding assistant, for repo-aware coding.
  - **Continue**: Added MCP support to their IDE extension for seamless tool integration.
  - **Raygun**: Built an MCP server for error/performance data (December 18, 2024).
  - **Oat++**: Created a C++ MCP implementation with API auto-generation (December 11, 2024).
  - **Community**: Projects like Brave Search, Kubernetes, and LangGraph servers via curated lists.
