# Flake8 ignoring .venv exclusions  - Solved

Educational Walkthrough: Fixing Flake8 When It Ignores Exclusions in venv (Beginner-Friendly)

Imagine you’re working on a Python project, and you’re using Flake8—a tool that checks your code for style and errors—to keep it neat. You’ve told Flake8 to skip certain folders (like venv/ where your project’s virtual environment lives) by listing them in a config file called .flake8. But Flake8 keeps checking those folders anyway! This walkthrough will help you figure out why and fix it, step-by-step, even if you’re new to coding or Linux.

We’ll assume you’re in your project folder (e.g., ~/myproject/), using a Linux system like Ubuntu, and you’ve installed Flake8. Let’s learn how to solve this together!

Step 1: Check What Flake8 You’re Using

Flake8 is like a program with different versions (think of it like app updates on your phone). Older versions might have glitches, so we need to see which one you have.

- What to Do: Open your terminal (a window where you type commands) and type:
    
    bash
    
    ```bash
    flake8 --version
    ```
    
    Press Enter. You’ll see something like:
    
    ```
    7.0.0 (pycodestyle: 2.11.1, pyflakes: 3.2.0) CPython 3.12.3 on Linux
    ```
    
    - The number 7.0.0 is the Flake8 version. The other parts (pycodestyle, etc.) are helper tools it uses.
- Why It Matters: If your version is old (say, below 7.0.0), it might not understand your config file properly.
- Fix It: If it’s old, update Flake8 with this command:
    
    bash
    
    ```bash
    pip3 install --user flake8 --upgrade
    ```
    
    - pip3: A tool to install Python programs.
    - -user: Installs it just for you, not the whole system (safer for beginners).
    - -upgrade: Gets the latest version (e.g., 7.1.2 as of March 2025).
    After running this, check again:
    
    bash
    
    ```bash
    /home/yourusername/.local/bin/flake8 --version
    ```
    
    - Replace yourusername with your actual username (type whoami to find it).
    - This uses the new Flake8 you installed.

Step 2: See If Flake8 Finds Your Config File

Flake8 looks for a file like .flake8 in your project folder to know what to skip. Let’s check if it’s finding it.

- What to Do: Type:
    
    bash
    
    ```bash
    flake8 --verbose . 2>&1 | grep "config file"
    ```
    
    - flake8 --verbose: Runs Flake8 and shows extra details (--verbose means "talk more").
    - .: Tells Flake8 to check the current folder and everything inside it.
    - 2>&1: Combines all messages (normal and error ones) into one place.
    - | grep "config file": Searches the output for the words "config file" (the | is like passing a note to grep, which filters text).
- What You Might See:
    - using config file /home/yourusername/myproject/.flake8: Great! It found your .flake8.
    - Nothing: Uh-oh, it’s not seeing it.
- Why It Matters: If Flake8 doesn’t find .flake8, it ignores your exclusions and checks everything.
- Fix It: If nothing shows up, tell Flake8 exactly where your config is:
    
    bash
    
    ```bash
    flake8 --config=.flake8 --verbose .
    ```
    
    - -config=.flake8: Says "use this file right here."
    If it still doesn’t mention "config file" but works (we’ll test later), don’t worry—some versions (like 7.0.0) are quiet about it.

Step 3: Check and Fix Your .flake8 File

Your .flake8 file is like a rulebook for Flake8. If the rules are written wrong, Flake8 might skip them. Let’s look at a common mistake.

- Example Broken .flake8: Imagine your project has folders like venv/ (for virtual environments) and test_dir/. You wrote:
    
    ini
    
    ```
    [flake8]
    exclude =
        venv/*,  # This is tricky!
        test_dir/,
        *.md,
    ```
    
    - Save this by typing nano .flake8 (a simple editor), pasting it, then pressing Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X.
- The Problem:
    - venv/*: This tells Flake8 to skip files inside venv/ (like venv/script.py), but not venv/ itself. So Flake8 still looks inside!
    - test_dir/: The / isn’t needed and might confuse Flake8.
- Fix It: Write it like this instead:
    
    bash
    
    ```bash
    echo "[flake8]" > .flake8
    echo "exclude =" >> .flake8
    echo "    venv" >> .flake8
    echo "    test_dir" >> .flake8
    echo "    *.md" >> .flake8
    echo "max-line-length = 120" >> .flake8
    ```
    
    - echo: Writes text.
    - >: Starts a new file.
    - >>: Adds lines to it.
    - Key Change: Use venv and test_dir (no /* or /) to skip the whole folders.
    - .md: Skips all Markdown files (e.g., readme.md).
- Why It Works: Flake8 needs the folder name itself to skip it entirely, not just its contents.
- Extra Tip: If you have both venv/ and .venv/ (some projects use a dot), add both:
    
    bash
    
    ```bash
    echo "    .venv" >> .flake8
    ```
    

Step 4: Test If Exclusions Work

Let’s see if Flake8 skips venv/ and test_dir/ now.

- What to Do: Run:
    
    bash
    
    ```bash
    flake8 --config=.flake8 --verbose . > output.txt 2>&1
    ```
    
    - This saves all Flake8’s messages to output.txt.
- Then check:
    
    bash
    
    ```bash
    cat output.txt | grep "venv\|test_dir"
    ```
    
    - cat output.txt: Shows the file.
    - | grep "venv\|test_dir": Looks for venv or test_dir (\| means "or").
- What You Might See:
    - Nothing: Awesome! Flake8 skipped them.
    - checking ...venv/script.py: Oh no, it’s still looking inside venv/.
    - skipping ...venv/...: Perfect, it’s working but mentioning it.
- Fix It: If you see checking ...venv..., double-check .flake8. Make sure it’s:
    
    ini
    
    ```
    [flake8]
    exclude =
        venv
        test_dir
        *.md
    ```
    

Step 5: Try Exclusions Without a Config File

Let’s test if Flake8 can skip folders when you tell it directly, not through .flake8.

- What to Do:
    
    bash
    
    ```bash
    flake8 --exclude=venv,test_dir --verbose . > output.txt 2>&1
    cat output.txt | grep "venv\|test_dir"
    ```
    
    - -exclude=venv,test_dir: Tells Flake8 to skip these folders right in the command.
- Why It Matters:
    - If this works (no venv or test_dir in output), the problem was in .flake8.
    - If it fails, Flake8 itself might be broken—go back to Step 1 and update it.

Step 6: Make It Easy with a Script

If everything works with --config=.flake8, let’s save it in a script so you don’t have to type it every time.

- What to Do:
    
    bash
    
    ```bash
    echo "#!/bin/bash" > flake8_check.sh
    echo "flake8 --config=.flake8 ." >> flake8_check.sh
    chmod +x flake8_check.sh
    ./flake8_check.sh > output.txt 2>&1
    cat output.txt | grep "venv\|test_dir"
    ```
    
    - First echo: Starts the script with the Bash shebang (tells the computer it’s a script).
    - Second echo: Adds the Flake8 command.
    - chmod +x: Makes it runnable (like turning on a “Run” button).
    - ./flake8_check.sh: Runs it.
    - Final cat: Checks the result.
- Why It Helps: Now you just type ./flake8_check.sh to check your code, and it’ll always use your .flake8.

What You Learned

- Flake8 Versions: Newer is better—update if it’s old.
- Config Files: Flake8 needs .flake8 to know what to skip, but it might not find it automatically.
- Exclusions: Write venv, not venv/*, to skip the whole folder. List every folder you don’t want checked.
- Testing: Use --verbose and grep to see what Flake8’s doing.
- Scripts: Save commands in a file to make life easier.

Example Working .flake8

ini

```
[flake8]
exclude =
    venv
    .venv
    test_dir
    *.md
    *.txt
max-line-length = 120  # Lines can be 120 characters long
ignore = E203, W503     # Skip some picky rules
```

If It Still Doesn’t Work 

- Check Other Configs: Look at:
    
    bash
    
    ```bash
    cat ~/.flake8
    cat ~/.config/flake8
    ```
    
    If they exist, move them with:
    
    bash
    
    ```bash
    mv ~/.flake8 ~/.flake8.bak
    ```
    
    And try again.
